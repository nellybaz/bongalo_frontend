    <h2>  1. Scope of the Services</h2>
    <p>

         
    By using or accessing Bongalo platform, a subdomains, any mobile application for such websites or any other website operated by us on which these Terms and Conditions are posted via a link, you acknowledge and agree that you are subject to the following terms and conditions, as well as our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Site, and is incorporated by reference (These Terms and Conditions with the Privacy Policy shall be referred to as the "Terms"). Please read these Terms carefully, as they contain important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than court.

<ul>
    <li>
        1.1 The Bongalo Platform is an online marketplace that enables registered users (“Members'') and certain third parties who offer services (Members and third parties who offer services are “Hosts” and the services they offer are “Host Services”) to publish such Host Services on the Bongalo Platform (“Listings”) and to communicate and transact directly with Members that are seeking to book such Host Services (Members using Host Services are “Guests”). Host Services may include the offering of vacation, apartments,  homes or other properties for use ("Accommodations"), access to unique events and locations (“Events' '), and a variety of other travel and non-travel related services.
    </li>

    <li>
        1.2 We urge all users to be responsible about their use of this platform and any transaction entered into as a result of either listing a property or renting a property. Bongalo does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver, or supply any Listings or Host Services, nor is Bongalo an organiser or retailer of travel packages. Hosts alone are responsible for their Listings and Host Services. When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. Bongalo is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Members, nor is Bongalo a real estate broker or insurer. Bongalo is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the payment terms facilitated by our partners.
    </li>

    <li>
        1.3 While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, Bongalo has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Host Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content (as defined below), or (iii) the performance or conduct of any Member or third party. Bongalo does not endorse any Member, Listing or Host Services. Any references to a Member being "verified" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process on Bongalo and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Bongalo about any Member, including of the Member's identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay in an Accommodation, participate in an Experience or Event or use other Host Services, accept a booking request from a Guest, or communicate and interact with other Members, whether online or in person. Verified Images (as defined below) are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of a Listing at the time the photograph was taken, and are therefore not an endorsement by Bongalo of any Host or Listing.
    </li>

    <li>
        1.4 If you choose to use the Bongalo Platform as a Host, your relationship with Bongalo is limited to being an independent, third-party contractor, and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of Bongalo for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf, or for the benefit, of Bongalo. Bongalo does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in your performance under these Terms specifically, including in connection with your provision of the Host Services. You acknowledge and agree that you have complete discretion whether to list Host Services or otherwise engage in other business or employment activities.
    </li>

    <li>
        1.5 To promote the Bongalo Platform and to increase the exposure of Listings to potential Guests, Listings and other Member Content may be displayed on other websites, in applications, within emails, and in online and offline advertisements. To assist Members who speak different languages, Listings and other Member Content may be translated, in whole or in part, into other languages. Bongalo cannot guarantee the accuracy or quality of such translations and Members are responsible for reviewing and verifying the accuracy of such translations. The Bongalo Platform may contain translations powered by Google. Google disclaims all warranties related to the translations, express or implied, including any warranties of accuracy, reliability, and any implied warranties for merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
    </li>

    <li>
        1.6 The Bongalo Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources (“Third-Party Services”). Such Third-Party Services may be subject to different terms and conditions and privacy practices. Bongalo is not responsible or liable for the availability or accuracy of such Third-Party Services, or the content, products, or services available from such Third-Party Services. Links to such Third-Party Services are not an endorsement by Bongalo of such Third-Party Services.
    </li>
    <li>
        1.7 Due to the nature of the Internet, Bongalo cannot guarantee the continuous and uninterrupted availability and accessibility of the Bongalo Platform. Bongalo may restrict the availability of the Bongalo Platform or certain areas or features thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity of our servers, or to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the Bongalo Platform. Bongalo may improve, enhance and modify the Bongalo Platform and introduce new Bongalo Services from time to time.
    </li>

    <h2>2. Eligibility, Using the Bongalo Platform, Member Verification</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                2.1 In order to access and use the Bongalo Platform or register an Bongalo Account you must be an individual at least 18 years old or a duly organized, validly existing business, organization or other legal entity in good standing under the laws of the country you are established and able to enter into legally binding contracts.
            </li>
            <li>
                2.3 Bongalo may make access to and use of the Bongalo Platform, or certain areas or features of the Bongalo Platform, subject to certain conditions or requirements, such as completing a verification process, meeting specific quality or eligibility criteria, meeting Ratings or Reviews thresholds, or a Member’s booking and cancellation history.
            </li>
            <li>
                2.4 User verification on the Internet is difficult and we do not assume any responsibility for the confirmation of any Member’s identity. Notwithstanding the above, for safety,  transparency and fraud prevention purposes, and as permitted by applicable laws, we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask Members to provide a form of government identification or other information or undertake additional checks designed to help verify the identities or backgrounds of Members, (ii) screen Members against third party databases or other sources and request reports from service providers, and (iii) where we have sufficient information to identify a Member, obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or an equivalent version of background or registered sex offender checks in your local jurisdiction (if available).
            </li>
            <li>
                2.5 The access to or use of certain areas and features of the Bongalo Platform may be subject to separate policies, standards or guidelines, or may require that you accept additional terms and conditions, before you can access the relevant areas or features of the Bongalo Platform. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions applicable to a specific area or feature of the Bongalo Platform, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your access to or use of that area or feature, unless specified otherwise in the latter terms and conditions.

                Bongalo reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time in accordance with this provision. If we make changes to these Terms, we will post the revised Terms on the Bongalo Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. We will also provide you with notice of the modifications by email at least thirty (30) days before the date they become effective. If you disagree with the revised Terms, you may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. We will inform you about your right to terminate the Agreement in the notification email.

These features do not require that you share your credentials with any other person. No third party is authorized by Bongalo to ask for your credentials, and you shall not request the credentials of another Member.

    <p>
        <ul>

                Bongalo generally supports payment amounts that are payable from or to Guests or Hosts to the smallest unit supported by a given currency (i.e., U.S. cents, Euro cents or other supported currencies). Where Bongalo’s third-party payment services provider does not support payments in the smaller unit supported by a given currency, Bongalo may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down the displayed amounts that are payable from or to Guests or Hosts to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (i.e. to the nearest dollar, Euro or other supported currency); for example, Bongalo may round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and round down an amount of $101.49 to $101.00.

If a Host fails to provide us with the required documentation under applicable law (e.g., a tax number) that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we reserve the right to withhold payouts up to the tax-relevant amount as required by law, until resolution.
