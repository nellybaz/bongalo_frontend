        <h3 id="sharing-personal">Sharing of Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
          We share your personal information as described below and in this
          Privacy Statement, and as permitted by applicable laws.
        </p>
        <h4>Third-party service providers.</h4>
        <p>
          We share your personal information with third parties in connection
          with the delivery of services to you and the operation of our business
          (for example, to provide payment-card processing, customer service,
          business analytics, and fraud-prevention and compliance services, and
          to serve you with advertising tailored to your interests). These
          third-party service providers are required to protect personal
          information we share with them and may not use any directly
          identifying personal information other than to provide the services
          for which we have contracted them. They are not allowed to use the
          personal information we share for purposes of their own direct
          marketing (unless you have separately consented to such use under the
          terms provided by the third party).
        </p>
        <h4>Travel suppliers.</h4>
        <p>
          We share personal information with travel-related suppliers such as
          property owners and managers, and where available, activity providers,
          and rail and cruise lines who fulfill your booking. Please note that
          travel suppliers may contact you to obtain additional information if
          and as required to facilitate your booking or to otherwise provide the
          travel or associated services.
        </p>

        <h4>Business partners and offers.</h4>
        <p>
          If we promote a program or offer a service or product in conjunction
          with a third-party business partner, we will share your information
          with that partner to assist in marketing or to provide the associated
          product or service. In most of those cases, the program or offer will
          include the name of the third-party business partner, either alone or
          with ours, or you will be redirected to the website of that business
          with notice. An example of such a business-partner relationship would
          be a third-party loyalty program for which you could earn points by
          completing a booking on our platform.
        </p>

        <h4>Other third parties.</h4>
        <p>
          When you access certain features such as Facebook’s “Like” button, or
          use a single sign-on that allows you to login to our online services
          with your social-media credentials, you will share information with
          the social media company or other provider, such as the fact that you
          have visited or interacted with us. For more information, see our
          Cookie Statement. The third-party provider may combine this
          information with other information they have about you. The personal
          information shared will be governed by the third-party provider’s
          privacy policy (including any personal information we may access via
          the third-party provider). These third-party providers should inform
          you about how you can modify your privacy settings on their sites.
        </p>
        <h4>Legal rights and obligations.</h4>
        <p>
          We may disclose your personal information to enforce our policies, or
          where we are permitted (or believe in good faith that we are required)
          to do so by applicable law, such as in response to a request by a law
          enforcement or governmental authority, in connection with actual or
          proposed litigation, or to protect and defend our property, people, or
          other rights or interests. We may also share your personal information
          pursuant to a subpoena or other legal request, or as necessary to
          remit certain taxes in the course of processing payments as required
          by law or legal process.
        </p>
        <h4>Corporate transactions.</h4>
        <p>
          We may share your personal information in connection with a corporate
          transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, assignment,
          or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. In the case of
          an acquisition, we will inform the buyer that it may use your personal
          information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Statement.

            unsubscribe.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we are processing your personal information on the basis of
            consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us.
            Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any
            processing that occurred before you withdrew consent and it will not
            affect our processing of your personal information that is conducted

          by us (first-party cookies) or delivered by a third-party partner or
          supplier (third-party cookies). Cookies are either session cookies or
          persistent cookies. Session cookies enable sites to recognize and link
          the actions of a user during a browsing session and expire at the end
          of each session. Persistent cookies help us recognize you as an
          existing user, and these cookies are stored on your system or device
          until they expire, although you can delete them before the expiration
          date.

          <li>
            Web beacons, gifs, and clear gifs are tiny graphics, each with a
            unique identifier, that are embedded invisibly on sites and in
            emails. Web beacons allow us to know if a certain page was visited
            or if ad banners on our sites and other sites are effective. We also
            use web beacons in our HTML-based emails to let us know whether our
            emails have been opened by recipients, which helps us to gauge the
            effectiveness of certain communications, promotions, and marketing
            campaigns.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity-based beacons send one-way signals over very short
            distances, to communicate with associated apps installed on your
            phone or mobile device. They can notify you, for example, about
            experiences related to your trip and can alert you to related deals
            or promotions. Beacons communicate with your device only when you
            are in close proximity and only if you have given consent within the
            relevant mobile application.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pixels are small objects embedded into a web page that are not
            visible to the user. We use pixels to deliver cookies to your
            computer, facilitate the log-in process, monitor the activity on our
            sites, and deliver online advertising.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tags are small pieces of HTML code that tell your browser to request
            certain content generated by an ad server. We use tags to show you
            relevant advertising and promotions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scripts are pieces of JavaScript code that launch automatically when
            certain webpages load, to determine whether users view associated
            advertisements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Local Storage Objects, such as HTML 5, are used to store content and
            preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain
            features on our site to display advertising based upon your web
            browsing activity use Local Storage Objects to collect and store
            information.

            parties to collect information about your online activities through
            cookies to perform their services and may combine the information
            that they collect about you on our sites with other information that

            information on their sites and advertising networks, which collect
            information about your interests when you view or interact with one
            of the advertisements or tracking mechanisms they place on many
            different sites on the Internet. Our partners may make assumptions
            about your interests, characteristics, or preferences and add you to
            groups based on those assumptions in order to show you tailored
            advertisements. Bongalo does not have access to the cookies these
            third parties may use to collect information about your interests,

        <h5>Your information choices</h5>
        <p>
          You can choose not to receive tailored online advertising on this site
          and other sites and learn more about opting out of having your
          information used for tailored advertising purposes. Note that if you
          choose not to receive tailored ads, you will still see online
          advertisements, but they will be general and less relevant to you.
        </p>

        <h5>How can you manage your cookies?</h5>
        <p>
          You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse
          cookies whenever you like, but please remember if you do choose to
          reject cookies, your access to some of the functionality and areas of

        <h5>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.</h5>
        <p>
          Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to sites with
          which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web
          browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear
          whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether
          users are even aware of them. Participants in the leading
          Internet-standards-setting organization that is addressing this issue
          are in the process of determining what, if anything, sites should do
          when they receive such signals. We currently do not take action in
          response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established
          and accepted, we will reassess our sites’ responses to these signals
          and make appropriate updates to this Cookie Statement.
        </p>

        <h5>Updates to Privacy Statement</h5>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Statement in response to changing laws or
          technical or business developments. You can see when this Privacy
          Statement was last updated by checking the “last updated” date
          displayed at the top of this Statement. We shall also send you
          communications informing you of the changes with this privacy
          statement when it happens.
